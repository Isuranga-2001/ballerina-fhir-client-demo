**ballerina-fhir-client-demo**  
An open-source demo app built using Ballerina to showcase seamless integration with HL7Â® FHIRÂ® APIs via the `ballerinax/health.clients.fhir` connector. This project provides practical examples of authenticating, querying, creating, and managing FHIR resourcesâ€”enabling developers to quickly understand how to work with healthcare data using Ballerina.

**Features Demonstrated:**
- Connect to FHIR-compliant servers with OAuth2 or Basic Auth
- Perform standard CRUD operations and custom FHIR interactions
- Handle bulk data export and capability statements
- Support for JSON/XML payloads and pagination of bundle resources

**Purpose:**  
This demo serves as a starter kit for developers exploring Ballerina for healthtech solutions, particularly around FHIR-based interoperability.
